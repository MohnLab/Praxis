Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs

rule map_paired_end:
    input: /home/david/SBC/GD1/rawData/AC2_1.fastq, /home/david/SBC/GD1/rawData/AC2_2.fastq
    output: cat_folder/AC2.fq
    jobid: 5
    wildcards: sample=AC2

Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
