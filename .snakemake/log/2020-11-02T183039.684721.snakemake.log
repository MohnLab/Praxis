MissingOutputException in line 52 of /home/david/SBC/LE3/Praxis/rules/download.smk:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
transcriptome/reads/untrimmed/wt_Ac2_1.fastq
transcriptome/reads/untrimmed/wt_Ac2_2.fastq
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
